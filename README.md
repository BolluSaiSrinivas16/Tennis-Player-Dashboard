# Images Folder

This folder contains all the images used in the **Tennis Player Profile and Statistics Dashboard** project. 

## Contents
1. **Player Photos**: Profile pictures of Grand Slam-winning tennis players.
2. **Icons**: Various icons used across the dashboard (e.g., comparison icons, loading icons).
3. **Background Images**: Decorative images for the website's design and layout.
4. **Logos**: Project or sponsor-related logos (if applicable).

## Guidelines
- **Image Format**: Use `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.svg` formats for compatibility.
- **Naming Convention**: 
  - Player photos: Use `firstname_lastname.jpg` (e.g., `roger_federer.jpg`).
  - Icons: Use descriptive names (e.g., `compare_icon.svg`).
- **Resolution**: Ensure images are optimized for web use without losing quality (e.g., under 500KB per image).

## Notes
- Avoid adding unused or redundant images to keep the repository clean.
- Optimize all images before uploading to reduce load times on the dashboard.
- All images should comply with copyright regulations if sourced externally.
